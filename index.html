        <h2>About <span>Ethan</span></h2>
        <p id="about">&ensp; Ethan is my little brother and he turns 25 on November something! I love the little guy (not so little these days) and I wanted to both congratulate and humiliate him publically through my new found passion.
          Thus the Sweet Ass Birthday Site 2.0 was born. I wanted to create a space where we could share some of our favorite Ethan memories and stories.So here is mine...Ethan is not your average bear. He is a man of extremes. Run a few miles? Ethan ran 100 of them. Climbed a fourteener? Ethan does it with his hands tied to his feet. I have always admired his insane ability to commit to his extreme way of life. He makes it look easy. However, over the years he has developed some strange behaviors as a result... he knows what they are.<br>
          &ensp; <br>&ensp;  A few years ago we were all meeting up at the base of mount elbert for our family camp and hike. I selfishly decided to ride my motorcycle rather than ride with everyone else. I went up thinking I could just call someone and find out where they were camping. Of course there was no service so I had a choice to make. Do I just ride back home and call it a loss? or do I aimlessly search trails and campsites in the dark hoping I stumble upon the right spot? Not the smartest choice but I chose the ladder. After a few hours of searching I was about to call it when out of nowhere a pale lanky figure bolts on to the trail from the woods. Who else but my half naked brother Ethan." </p>

        <h4>Alyssa Bartle:</h4>
        <p>&ensp; "Ok so last time we were out there he was training for the bike race and road his bike all the way from his apartment to golden to eat breakfast with us. We went to a neat little french restaurant and he ordered a side of bacon. Just a side of bacon and he was like yea I don't want to eat too much because it makes me feel gross when I ride. Then his side of bacon came out with a little bit of arugula with it. He whispered to me that he knows it's just a garnish but he sure as shit going to eat it."</p>
        <h4>Karen Hood AKA Mom:</h4>
        <p>&ensp; "When Ethan was young enought to ride in a cart and old enought to talk we were shopping with Alyssa and Dylan(about 9 and 6) They were being squirrelly and I asked them to stop doing a few things. Ethan asked me "Where did we meet these two??" I can still remember his face saying this and I'm still laughing about that. I am not sure if this was a serious question to him. Knowing him today I think the answer is yes. I would also like to mention his real money(ape)? family, and the green guy"."</p>

          &ensp; "This was the day Ethan regained his confidence. A couple years before he had experienced a slight case of altitude sickness and had what seemed to be a panic attack. I just remember him saying that his heart hurt. I was terrified.
          Dylan was with and raced back to camp to frantically throw everything in the vehicle as Ethan and I slowly made it back down the mountain.<br><br>
          &ensp;The day this picture was taken I could tell Ethan was anxious but as soon as we reached the upper ridge of Democratic you could see the fear or anxiousness leave him. He had regained all confidence.
           This speaks to his ability to press on and never give up but more importantly his relentless pursuit of all things that bring him joy and peace.
           May your journey continue to be full of fun and adventure. Happy Birthday Ethan! Congratulations on making it a quarter century!"
